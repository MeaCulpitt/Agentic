## Go-To-Market Strategy

### Initial Target Users & Use Cases

**Early adopter miners:**
- Open-source developers already building agent tools
- Domain specialists (legal, medical, financial professionals who can code or vibe code)
- Indie hackers wanting to monetize niche expertise

**Anchor use cases:**
- Browser automation (form filling, scraping, screenshots)
- Search & research (web search, document lookup, data aggregation)
- Communication (email, Slack, Discord, SMS)
- Document processing (PDF extraction, OCR, summarization)

**Pilot partners:**
- OpenClaw (agent framework with existing user base)
- AutoGPT community (large developer audience)
- LangChain ecosystem (integration-hungry developers)

### Distribution & Growth Channels

**Developer communities:**
- Bittensor Discord (existing TAO holders)
- Agent framework Discords (LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI)
- Twitter/X (AI agent influencers)
- Hacker News / Reddit (technical audiences)

**Content marketing:**
- Tutorials: "Build your first skill and earn TAO"
- Case studies: "How [developer] earns $X/month from Shopify skill"
- Integration guides for each major agent framework
- Bitcast (SN93) briefs on X and YouTube

**Partnerships:**
- Agent framework integrations (native skill discovery)
- Validator partnerships (established TAO validators)
- Enterprise pilots (agents needing specific capabilities)

### Incentives for Early Participation

**Miners:**
- Early mover advantage: 3x uniqueness multiplier for pioneering categories
- Low competition: Fewer miners early = larger share of emissions per miner
- Featured placement: First skills in each category get marketplace prominence

**Validators:**
- Standard validator economics (no special incentives needed)
- Low barrier: Run reference implementation, no custom development
- Subnet owner provides well-documented, maintained validator code

**Users (Agents):**
- Competitive pricing: Decentralized = lower fees than centralized alternatives
- Quality guarantees: Validator-verified skills reduce integration risk
- No lock-in: Standard API, switch skills freely

### Launch Sequence

**Week 1-4 (Pre-launch):**
- Deploy testnet with 5-10 reference skills
- Recruit 3-5 validators
- Integrate with OpenClaw for pilot testing

**Week 5-8 (Soft launch):**
- Mainnet deployment
- Invite-only miner access (quality control)
- 20-30 skills across core categories

**Week 9+ (Public launch):**
- Open miner registration
- Marketing push to agent developer communities
- Continuous iteration based on usage data
